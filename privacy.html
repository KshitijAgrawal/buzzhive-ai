            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2025</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-content">
            <p>BuzzHive and its operators ("we," "our," or "us") are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we store it, and the rights available to California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").</p>
            <p>By using BuzzHive, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>

            <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>Username (alias you choose; does not need to reflect your real identity)</li>
                <li>Authentication identifiers (Google/Apple)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Location Information</h3>
            <p>Collected only with permission:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Approximate or precise device location</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Used to display nearby hives and local content.</p>

            <h3>1.3 User-Generated Content</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Buzzes, alerts, posts, messages, comments, and any content you submit to hives</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.4 Device &amp; Diagnostic Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Device model and OS</li>
                <li>Push notification token</li>
                <li>Crash logs and diagnostics</li>
                <li>Basic usage data for performance and stability</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.5 AI Feature Data</h3>
            <p>
                If you use AI-powered features, the relevant text or metadata may be sent to third-party AI providers
                (currently OpenAI) solely to generate a response. OpenAI does not use your data to train its models.
            </p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide, operate, and maintain BuzzHive</li>
                <li>Authenticate your account</li>
                <li>Display location-based hives and content</li>
                <li>Improve app performance and user experience</li>
                <li>Detect, prevent, and address abuse or security issues</li>
                <li>Send optional notifications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sell personal information</li>
                <li>Share your data with advertisers or data brokers</li>
                <li>Use your data for targeted advertising</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Authentication</h2>
            <p>
                BuzzHive and its operators use Google Sign-In and Apple Sign-In. We may receive your email address, display name (if provided),
                and authentication IDs. We never access your Google or Apple password.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Location Data</h2>
            <p>
                Location data is used solely to enable features such as nearby hive discovery and local content ranking.
                You may disable location permissions at any time in your device settings.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Content You Share</h2>
            <p>
                Content you post in hives (buzzes, alerts, messages, and other submissions) is stored on our servers and
                treated as user-generated content. Depending on the hive's settings (public, local, or private), your content
                may be visible to other users, members of specific hives, or the general public.
            </p>
            <h3>Retention of Public &amp; Local Content</h3>
            <p>
                If you delete your account, content posted in private hives is permanently deleted. Content posted in public
                or local hives may remain because it forms part of a shared community space. In these cases, we make best
                efforts to remove or anonymize your identity by replacing your username with "[Deleted User]". Remaining
                content is no longer reasonably linkable to you. You may delete your own posts at any time before deleting
                your account.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
            <p>
                We store your data in secure cloud infrastructure provided by third-party providers (currently Microsoft Azure,
                including Azure-based database services). We use industry-standard protections such as encryption in transit
                (HTTPS/SSL), encryption at rest, access control and authentication protections, abuse prevention systems,
                and security monitoring.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>BuzzHive and its operators rely on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Sign-In</li>
                <li>Apple Sign-In</li>
                <li>Google Maps APIs</li>
                <li>Microsoft Azure (hosting &amp; database)</li>
                <li>OpenAI (AI responses)</li>
                <li>Expo/Firebase (if applicable)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These services may process limited data needed to provide their functionality and are governed by their own
                privacy policies. We do not share your personal information with advertisers or unrelated third parties.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                We retain your data while your account is active. When you delete your account, your personal information,
                authentication data, and private-hive content are permanently deleted within 30 days. Public and local hive
                content you created may continue to be displayed for community integrity, with your username replaced by
                "[Deleted User]". Non-identifiable data may remain in system logs and temporary backups until automatically removed.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Your Rights Under CCPA (California Residents Only)</h2>
            <h3>9.1 Right to Know (Categories Only)</h3>
            <p>
                You may request to know the categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for which these
                categories are used.
            </p>
            <h3>9.2 Right to Delete</h3>
            <p>
                You may request deletion of your personal information. Public and local hive content posted by you may remain,
                with your identity replaced by "[Deleted User]".
            </p>
            <h3>9.3 Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing</h3>
            <p>
                We do not sell or share your personal information for advertising; no opt-out mechanism is required.
            </p>
            <h3>9.4 Right to Non-Discrimination</h3>
            <p>
                We do not discriminate against users who exercise their CCPA rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                To exercise any CCPA rights, contact: <a href="mailto:help.buzzhive@gmail.com">help.buzzhive@gmail.com</a>
            </p>

            <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                BuzzHive and its operators do not intend BuzzHive for users under age 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
                If such data is identified, it will be deleted promptly.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates are effective when posted, as reflected in the
                "Last Updated" date above.
            </p>
